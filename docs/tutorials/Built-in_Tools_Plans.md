# 📚 Built-in Tools & Plans

## Built-in Tools

To see the full list of built-in tools and their descriptions, please see the [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) file.

To enable or disable some of the tools, enter `.tools` in the BibleMate AI prompt.

When `agent` or `partner` is enabled, all enabled built-in tools are considered and automatically selected for each step in fulfilling the user’s request.

## Built-in Plans

Built-in plans are predefined, frequently used 'master plans' that users can quickly access. Currently, we have added two built-in plans for demonstration purposes.

Starts your prompt with a forward slash `/` to call a plan, e.g.:

> /simple_bible_study John 3:16

> /bible_devotion Deut 6:4
