# 📝 Custom Master Plan

In some cases, you may want to specify a `custom plan` with multiple tools specified for different steps for a complex task, rather than having a `master plan` automatically generated in fully automatic agent mode.

You can use a custom 'Master Plan' of your own, instead of one generated by BibleMate AI. To do this, start your BibleMate AI prompt with '@@' followed by your own master plan for a Bible study. 

For example,

```
@@ Analyze John 3:16 with the following steps: 
1. Call tool 'retrieve_english_bible_verses' for Bible text, 
2. Call tool 'retrieve_bible_cross_references' for Bible cross-references, 
3. Call tool 'interpret_new_testament_verse' for interpretation, and 
4. Call tool 'write_bible_theology' to explain its theology.
```

Another example:

```
@@ Write touching devotion on Deuteronomy 6:4 with the following steps:
1. Analyze the themes using @study_old_testament_themes
2. Identify and explain key biblical keywords from the passage using @identify_bible_keywords
3. Write insights for the devotion using @write_bible_insights
4. Relate the passage to daily life using @write_bible_applications
5. Compose a touching devotion using @write_bible_devotion.
Ensure each step is clearly addressed and the final output is cohesive and inspiring
